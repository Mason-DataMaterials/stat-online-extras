- "available as a free PDF at openintro.org and for under $10 as a paperback on amazon.com" = "available for free in PDF at openintro.org and in paperback from under $10 at amazon.com"
- it seemed a little odd that Figure 1 appeared before the first substantive text in this document.
- "heteroskedastic is a fancy term for non-constant variance" = "heteroskedastic simply means non-constant variance"
- "represents be the" = "are the"
- "model solution" = "modeling solution"
- "being more variable" = "because they are more variable"
- "tip-off" = "clue"
- "we would look" = "we look"
- "slight skew" = "very slight right skew"
- "ln" = "{\it ln}"
- Consider using "ln" instead of "log" throughout
- "used in OpenIntro" = "used by OpenIntro"
- "formula, and this" = "formula. This"
- "we do this by" = "we back-transform by"
- "and then solving" = "and then solve"
- "A plot of $y^{\star} = \log y$ agains $x$. The relationship between the transformed version of $y$ and $x$ appears to be linear" = "A plot of $y^{\star}$ (the result of transforming $y$ by taking the natural logarithm $\log y$) against $x$. The relationship between $y^{\star}$ and $x$ appears to be linear."
- "nonlinear fit to data. The fit was generated by fitting a model" = "nonlinear curve through the data generated by fitting a model"
- "For example, in the model shown… $y_{x=20}$" adds something, but also feels a bit cumbersome. It may be a net win to drop that content and end simply with "exponentially relative to $x$."
- "For this reason" = "Therefore"
- "please review Chapter 8" = "visit Chapter 8"
- "Practical Regression and ANOVA in R" = "{\it Practical Regression and ANOVA in R}"
- "However, please note" = "We should note"
- "Let's star by fitting" = "We will start by fitting"
- "this colleague" = "the colleague"
- "Here a" = "In this example a"
- "insufficient. We will" = "insufficient, so we will"
- "Alternatively, we could… splines." moves to footnote.
- "with only $x^2$ added to the model" = ""
